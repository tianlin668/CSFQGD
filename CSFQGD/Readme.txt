CSFQGD Dataset

We provide three forms of data files:  original data, data processed by BMES labeling method for sequence labeling task, 
and annotated data for sequence classification generation task.

For example, 
CSFQGD/Medicine/medicine.txt is the original data

CSFQGD/Medicine/train.txt is used to train the model for sequence labeling task
CSFQGD/Medicine/train.txt is used to validate the model for sequence labeling task
CSFQGD/Medicine/test.txt is used to test the model for sequence labeling task

CSFQGD/Medicine/train_src.txt is source sequence used to train the model for sequence classification generation task
CSFQGD/Medicine/train_tgt.txt is target sequence used to train the model for sequence classification generation task
CSFQGD/Medicine/dev_src.txt is source sequence used to validate the model for sequence classification generation task
CSFQGD/Medicine/dev_tgt.txt is target sequence used to validate the model for sequence classification generation task
CSFQGD/Medicine/test_src.txt is source sequence used to test the model for sequence classification generation task
CSFQGD/Medicine/test_tgt.txt is target sequence used to test the model for sequence classification generation task




The codes and pretrained models will be released on GitHub in the near future.
